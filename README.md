# Second Chapter

    ## Components

    - We can store ui inside a variable and display it as much as time we want.
    - But a better way to do this is with the help of storing them as Components.
    - Components is just a javascript function that return some sort of UI or JSX. With the help of components we will always be returning some UI Components.
    - Every component needs to start with a capital letter.
    - Components are used widely if we need to reuse some piece of codes or when we want to organize things in a certain way that will help our project not looking so messy.

    ## Props

    - Props are short word for properties.
    - Props are javascript object that exist inside the argument of some sort of components.
    - Every react component will accepts an argument to it which is an object called props. This object will represent all the data that we might wanna pass in to this component.
    - We can pass every kind of data through props.

    ** Components and props reduces the number of codes which we may want to write.
